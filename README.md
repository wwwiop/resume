# resume

I created this firstly as a test, and secondly as a convienient way to access and share my resume in mobile- and printer-firnedly HTML format via [wwwiop.github.io/resume](https://wwwiop.github.io/resume). Content of the resume can be curated with a query string.

Variations of my resume:
* [Default Resume](https://wwwiop.github.io/resume) - short URL with no query string.
* [Artistic Resume](https://wwwiop.github.io/resume?i=bu-is-ss-sl-at-tm) - handy for small jobs and volunteer projects.
* [Software Resume](https://wwwiop.github.io/resume?i=bu-ni-si-ss-sl-tc-tm) - unfortunately leaves out my experience flipping burgers, as priceless as it may be to the tech industry.
* [1-Page Software Resume](https://wwwiop.github.io/resume?i=bu-ni-si-ss-sl) - for when brevity really counts.
* [Food Service Resume](https://wwwiop.github.io/resume?i=bu-sb-ex-md-wu-tm) - laugh now, but when OpenAI Codex does us all dirty, at least I'll have a plan B.
